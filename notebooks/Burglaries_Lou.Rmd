This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
burglaries <- read_csv("NSS_Projects/geospatial-r-Jorgen85Lex/data/burglaries_2023.csv")
burglaries
```

```{r}
dc <- st_read("NSS_Projects/geospatial-r-Jorgen85Lex/data/DC/DC.shp")
dc
```

```{r}
burglaries_geo <- st_as_sf(
  burglaries |> drop_na(latitude),
  coords = c('longitude', 'latitude'),
  crs = st_crs(dc)
)

burglaries_geo
```
```{r}
dc |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_sf(data = burglaries_geo, size = 0.1)

```

```{r}
burglaries_dc <- st_join(burglaries_geo, dc, join = st_within, left = FALSE)
burglaries_dc
```
PART 2 --- 
Now, merge in the census data. **Note:** Make sure that the final dataset contains all census tracts (there are some census tracts that had no burglaries).

```{r}
census <- read_csv("NSS_Projects/geospatial-r-Jorgen85Lex/data/census.csv")
census$NAME <- gsub(", Davidson County, Tennessee", "", census$NAME)
census$NAME <- gsub("^Census Tract ", "", census$NAME)
census
```
```{r}
merged_censusburg <- merge(census, burglaries_dc, by = "NAME")
merged_censusburg
```
```{r}
summary(merged_censusburg$population)
```

```{r}
summary(merged_censusburg$median_income)
```

```{r}
negative_income <- merged_censusburg %>%
  filter(median_income < 0)

negative_income
```

```{r}
merged_censusburg <- merged_censusburg[merged_censusburg$median_income >= 0, ]
```



```{r}
ggplot(merged_censusburg, aes(x=population, color = 'black'))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 30)
```
```{r}
ggplot(merged_censusburg, aes(x=median_income, color = 'black'))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 30)
```



```{r}
ggplot(merged_censusburg, aes(x=median_income, color = 'black'))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 5)
```

```{r}
 ggplot(merged_censusburg, aes(x = victim_ethnicity)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
```{r}
 ggplot(merged_censusburg, aes(x = weapon_description)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
```{r}
 ggplot(merged_censusburg, aes(x = victim_description)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "BLUE") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
Aggregate the data by census tract. **Warning:** each incident can appear multiple times if there are multiple victims, so be sure that you aren't double-counting any incidents. 
```{r}
merged_censusburg |> 
  count(incident_number)
```


```{r}
summary_censusburg <- merged_censusburg |> 
  group_by(NAMELSAD) |> 
  summarise(
    incidents = n_distinct(incident_number),
    victims_count = sum(victim_number, na.rm = TRUE),
    average_median_income = mean(median_income, na.rm = TRUE), 
    total_pop = sum(population, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

summary_censusburg
```

Which census tract had the highest number of burglaries? Which census tract had the highest number of burglaries per 1000 residents? 
```{r}
burglaries_by_tract <- merged_censusburg |> 
  group_by(NAMELSAD) |> 
  summarise(num_burglaries = n())

highest_burgs <- burglaries_by_tract |> 
  filter(num_burglaries == max(num_burglaries))

highest_burgs
```


```{r}
highest_burgs_1000<- merged_censusburg |> 
  group_by(NAMELSAD) |> 
  summarise(
    num_burglaries = n(), 
    total_population = sum(population, na.rm = TRUE),
    
  ) |> 
  mutate(burglaries_per_1000 = (num_burglaries/total_population) * 1000)

highest_burgs_1000
```


```{r}
highest_burglaries_per_1000 <- highest_burgs_1000 %>%
  filter(burglaries_per_1000 == max(burglaries_per_1000))

highest_burglaries_per_1000
```


Finally, look at the relationship between median income and number of aggravated burglaries per tract. How would you describe this relationship?

```{r}
summary_censusburg$average_median_income <- as.numeric(summary_censusburg$average_median_income)
summary_censusburg$incidents <- as.numeric(summary_censusburg$incidents)
```


```{r}
ggplot(summary_censusburg, aes(x = average_median_income, y = incidents)) +
  geom_point() 
  labs(title = "Relationship between Median Income and Aggravated Burglaries",
       x = "Median Income",
       y = "Number of Aggravated Burglaries")
```
### Bonus: Statistical Modeling

Fit a Poisson regression model with target variable the rate of burglaries per census tract and with predictor the median income. Offset using the log of the population so that we are looking at the rate of burglaries per population instead of the number of burglaries. How can you interpret the meaning of the output? How do the estimates from the model compare to the observed data?

```{r}
burg_poisson <- glm(num_burglaries ~ average_median_income + offset(log(population)), 
                    family = poisson, 
                    data = summary_censusburg)

summary(burg_poisson)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
